        <h2>Current State</h2>
        <p>We have 12 volunteers (5 males, 7 females), including 1 with physical disabilities, governed by a 3-level structure: Community Forum, Board of Directors, and Management. Our Management Team includes Station Manager, Administrator, Programs Manager, Marketing Manager, News Editor, and General Assistant.</p>
        <h2>Potential Areas for Growth</h2>
        <p>We aim to increase diversity by recruiting more volunteers with disabilities, enhance community engagement through our Forum, and expand mentorship for youth socio-economic development.</p>
