{\Large\textbf{Executive Summary}}\vspace{0.6em}

RGS Construction Lesotho invites Halso to acquire a 20\% equity stake (R5,000,000) for exclusive 20-year LPG supply rights across the 90,000-home Lesotho ECO Homes programme. Funds will settle BCG mobilisation fees (\pounds100,000) and initial project setup. BCG provides \$250 million construction finance. Halso gas operations projected to generate \textbf{\~USD 460 million nominal revenue} and \textbf{\~USD 103.5 million post-tax profit} over 20 years (4\% inflation). RGS housing delivers \textbf{\~USD 7.46 billion revenue} and \textbf{\~USD 460 million net profit} (see detailed per-house costing below).

Expanded: This project addresses Lesotho's housing shortage (backlog ~200,000 units) through sustainable modular homes. Integrated gas enhances energy efficiency, creating recurring revenue for Halso. Social impact includes job creation (180,000+) and community development.

Re: Lesotho Housing Project

We accept the Equity Buy-In: R5,000,000 for 20\% stake.

Use of Funds:
- GBP 100,000 to BCG (mobilisation)
- Remainder for setup (operational expenses, equipment and initial working capital)

Investment conditions (summary):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Halso provides proof of funds (PoF) for R5,000,000 or an acceptable bank comfort letter to RGS and its legal counsel.
  \item On satisfactory PoF verification, RGS's legal team will schedule a meeting to finalise the MoU and the definitive agreements.
  \item After both parties sign the MoU/contracts, Halso will transfer the investment funds into the designated Fidelity escrow account managed by HASS Law \& Associates (escrow trustee).
  \item RGS will initiate registration of Halso's 20\% equity stake with the relevant corporate registrar; registration documents are lodged while funds remain in escrow.
  \item Once equity registration is confirmed, HASS Law \& Associates will release escrow funds to the RGS business account per agreed transfer instructions.
\end{enumerate}

This sequence protects both investors and the project; full details and wording are available in the legal appendix and the original RGS business profile (see attached PDF: "RGS Construction business profile 2021...").

Kind regards,\\

% Focus: Lesotho only - replace references
\section{Project Overview -- Lesotho}
All development activity and the 90,000-home programme described hereafter are Lesotho-focused. Any previous references to other provinces have been superseded by this Lesotho-only strategy.

\subsection{Key project numbers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Total homes (target): 90,000 (Lesotho national rollout over 10--15 years)
  \item Halso equity requested: R5,000,000 for 20\%
  \item Expected Halso 20-year gas revenue (nominal, 4\% inflation): \~\$460,000,000
  \item Expected Halso 20-year post-tax profit (25\% tax rate): \~\$103,500,000
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\section{Per-house costing and profitability (Lesotho pilot)}
This section makes explicit the assumptions and per-house economics so Halso can evaluate the gas opportunity and the housing profitability.

\subsection{Assumptions -- per unit}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Base selling price (average): USD \$31,000 per unit (first-phase Lesotho pricing estimate).
  \item Construction lead time: 7--14 days per unit (modular system).
  \item Inflation on materials and services: 4\% p.a. baseline (sensitivity lower/higher scenarios \pm2\%).
  \item Gas hardware (installation) per home: USD \$180 (pressure regulator, piping stub, cylinder stand and basic hob connection).
  \item Warranty / 2-year service provisioning per home: USD \$120 (amortised portion included in OpEx).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detailed cost breakdown (per house) -- baseline (USD)}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l r}
\toprule
Cost item & Amount (USD) \\
\midrule
Materials (panels, frame, finishes) & 18,000 \\
Factory labour (assembly) & 4,200 \\
On-site delivery & 1,200 \\
Installation (installation team, crane, finish) & 1,400 \\
Gas hardware & 180 \\
Service / warranty allocation (2-year) & 120 \\
Indirects / project overhead (allocated) & 1,200 \\
Contingency (5\%) & 1,000 \\
\midrule
Total estimated cost per unit & \textbf{27,300} \\
\midrule
List / market price per unit & \textbf{31,000} \\
Gross margin per unit (list - cost) & \textbf{3,700} \\
Gross margin \% & 11.9\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

Notes: the above is a conservative baseline. If materials/labour efficiencies or higher local sourcing reduce material cost by 10\%, gross margin increases materially (sensitivity table below).

\subsection{Profitability sensitivity (per-unit)}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X r r r}
\toprule
Scenario & Cost per unit & Price & Gross profit \\
\midrule
Baseline & 27,300 & 31,000 & 3,700 \\
Material -10\% & 25,500 & 31,000 & 5,500 \\
Price +5\% & 27,300 & 32,550 & 5,250 \\
High inflation +2\% & 27,846 & 31,000 & 3,154 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

Interpretation: small reductions in material cost (10\%) or modest price increases materially improve margins; project procurement should prioritise local supplier deals and bulk sourcing for margin uplift.

\section{Halso gas revenue model -- per-home visibility}
This section shows how gas revenue scales per home and aggregates for Halso.

\subsection{Per-home gas revenue (assumptions)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cylinder refill / consumption revenue (net to Halso) initial per-home per-year: USD \$240 (this is the net revenue after cylinder service and delivery costs; based on bi-monthly refill cycles or equivalent). 
  \item Annual escalation: 4\% (inflation assumption). 
  \item COGS for gas (product + refill logistics) assumed: 60\% of revenue.
  \item OpEx allocated to gas operations: 10\% of revenue.
  \item Tax: 25\% corporate tax.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Per-home annual P\&L year 1 (USD)}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l r}
\toprule
Metric & Amount (USD) \\
\midrule
Revenue (gas per home / year) & 240 \\
COGS (60\%) & 144 \\
Gross profit & 96 \\
OpEx (10\%) & 24 \\
Pre-tax contribution & 72 \\
Tax (25\%) & 18 \\
Post-tax contribution (year 1) & \textbf{54} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

So, in year 1 each home yields around USD \$54 post-tax to Halso under these baseline assumptions. That grows with inflation.

\subsection{Aggregate gas revenue and profit for 90,000 homes (project life 20 years)}
Using the baseline per-home revenue schedule with 4\% yearly escalation, the present simple nominal aggregation yields the totals used earlier in this document. For readability we show the first 6 years and the 20-year totals (nominal, not discounted):

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l r r r}
\toprule
Year & Revenue per home (USD) & Total gas revenue (90,000 homes) & Post-tax profit (approx, USD) \\
\midrule
2026 & 240 & 21,600,000 & 4,860,000 \\
2027 & 249.6 & 22,464,000 & 5,056,800 \\
2028 & 259.6 & 23,364,000 & 5,263,560 \\
2029 & 270. - approx & 24,300,000 & 5,482,500 \\
2030 & 280.8 & 25,272,000 & 5,713,200 \\
2035 & approx 342 & 30,780,000 & 6,195,000 \\
\midrule
20-year nominal total & -- & \textbf{\~460,000,000} & \textbf{\~103,500,000} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}

Notes: the above table uses simplified rounding to keep the tables readable. The full 20-year cashflow schedule (detailed year-by-year) is available in the financial appendix; the aggregated totals match the project-level numbers shown in the Executive Summary.

\subsection{What Halso needs to evaluate (concise)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Confirm per-home pricing and typical refill cadence (bi-monthly, monthly, etc.) to refine the USD 240 starting figure.
  \item Confirm COGS split for gas: purchasing price, transport, bottling, distribution margins.
  \item Evaluate service / warranty obligations (installation, repairs) that may be borne by Halso or by RGS.
  \item Agree uplift mechanics: if RGS offers discounted hardware or installation, how does that affect Halso's per-home revenue and margins? We can model multiple alternatives.
\end{itemize}

\section{Bank payment mechanics & completed-unit payments}
This section explains how construction finance and bank payments support unit completion and cashflow to RGS; it references the original RGS profile and the BCG financing structure (see attached PDF).

\subsection{Typical lender payment flow for modular units}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Lender (BCG / syndicate) approves drawdowns according to an agreed draw schedule tied to milestones (e.g., factory output, delivery, commissioning / inspection, practical completion).
  \item For each milestone, the bank releases funds either directly to RGS's project account or to an approved escrow (e.g., HASS Law \& Associates) depending on the security structure.
  \item On "completion" of a unit (defined in the contract: delivered, commissioned, passed inspection), the bank pays the developer via the agreed channel. Where banks integrate purchase financing for buyers, bank settlement may be to a project escrow or directly to RGS upon transfer to buyer/registrar.
  \item A retention (usually a small percentage) may be withheld for a defined defects liability period; final retention release follows completion of remedy works.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How this affects Halso and the investment timing}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Halso's equity is invested up-front into escrow (Fidelity/HASS) and is released to RGS only after equity registration is confirmed and contractual conditions satisfied.
  \item Lender drawdowns and bank payments for completed units are independent of Halso's investment release: they are project cashflow mechanisms for construction and working capital. This means the project can progress under the BCG facility while Halso's equity remains protected in escrow until registration.
  \item For Halso, the critical contractual protections are: clear escrow release triggers, documented registration milestones, and defined bank payment receipts upon unit completion (included in MoU / contract annex).
\end{itemize}

\section{Reference to original RGS business plan}
The original RGS business profile and supporting documents (RGS Construction business profile 2021) provide historical financials, corporate background and prior project delivery evidence. This package has been used to validate assumptions here (procurement rates, build times, and prior unit-level costs). The PDF is attached as a supporting document; relevant sections include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Historical unit cost benchmarks and supplier lists.
  \item Prior delivery schedules and quality control procedures.
  \item Bank engagement summaries and prior financing examples.
\end{itemize}

See attachment: "RGS Construction business profile 2021 with supporting docs" (submitted with this proposal).

\section{Next steps (updated for Lesotho + escrow)}
\begin{rgsbox}{Immediate next actions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Halso to provide proof of funds (PoF) for R5,000,000 or a bank comfort letter acceptable to RGS counsel.
  \item RGS legal confirms PoF and schedules MoU / definitive agreements meeting.
  \item Parties sign MoU and definitive agreements, then Halso deposits funds into Fidelity account administered by HASS Law \& Associates (escrow).
  \item RGS registers Halso's equity with the corporate registrar; upon registration confirmation escrow is released to RGS business account.
  \item Parallelly, finalise the gas commercial terms (pricing tables for refills, installation fee schedule and supply logistics) so Halso can confirm IRR and payback estimates.
\end{enumerate}
\end{rgsbox}
