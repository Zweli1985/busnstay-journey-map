Executive Summary

This document is a comprehensive business plan and financial package prepared for Halso as a prospective strategic equity partner in RGS Construction's ECO Homes programme. It combines the investment proposal (R5,000,000 for 20% equity), project overview, phased rollout, sales plan, governance and risk management, and detailed financial statements focused on two separable streams:

1) RGS Construction — Core housing development (housing sales, construction P&L, balance sheet and cash flow).
2) Halso — Exclusive gas supply operations (20-year exclusivity for LPG supply to homes). Gas P&L and long-term projections are modelled separately to show the direct profitability to Halso.

Key investment highlights

- Equity ask: R5,000,000 in exchange for 20% of project-level equity.
- Catalytic debt: $250m construction loan from Broughton Capital Group (BCG) to fund build-out.
- Project scale: 90,000 eco-friendly modular homes in Lesotho delivered over ~10 years (phased rollout), with a Lesotho pilot/expansion option (9,000 homes) to de-risk and prove operations.
- Halso upside: Standalone gas revenue (20-year exclusive supply) modeled at nominal ~$460M revenue and ~$103.5M post-tax net profit over 20 years (4% inflation nominal), plus recurring annual post-tax profits once ramped.
- RGS returns: Housing P&L generates substantial development profits (summary metrics and 20-year P&L included in Financials section).

This plan is structured for clarity in due diligence, negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and immediate preparation of legal and governance frameworks.

1. Strategic rationale

- Demand & impact: Lesotho and neighbouring Limpopo have acute affordable housing shortages. The ECO Homes model addresses both shelter and resilience (flood-resistant, solar-enabled, rapid modular delivery).
- Synergies for Halso: Gas off-take is predictable and recurring. Exclusive supply to a contracted base of 90,000 homes for 20 years secures volume and margins while providing an anchor market to scale distribution, cylinders, logistics, and appliance sales.
- Risk-sharing: Equity from Halso aligns incentives; BCG debt finances construction, reducing initial capital calls by equity partners.

2. Offer & use of proceeds

- Offer: Halso invests R5,000,000 (~$310,244 at current rates) for a 20% equity stake in the Lesotho Housing Project entity.
- Immediate uses (proposed):
  - GBP 80,000 (≈ $109,000) to pay BCG mobilization/underwriting fees per invoice dated 06/01/2023.
  - Balance to project startup (site setup, equipment rentals, staffing and contingency). The full startup baseline in earlier plans was ~$556,800; Halso's equity will cover the mobilization fee and make a material contribution to initial setup.

3. Project timeline (high-level)

- End Feb 2026: Receipt of Halso equity. Mobilization of fees and initial setup.
- Mar–May 2026: MoU, legal documentation, governance, BCG site visits, refined forecasting, initial tranche drawdown planning.
- Jun–Dec 2026: Phase 1 build (pilot sites) — target 1,000–2,000 units; commence appliance & gas installations.
- 2027–2035: Phased scale to reach 90,000 cumulative homes in Lesotho (timeline and cadence flexible — see Sales Plan below).
- 2036–2045: Full operations, gas supply at scale, operations optimization and potential geographic extension.

4. Sales & go-to-market plan (detailed)

Objective: Deliver and sell homes while ensuring predictable occupancy, gas off-take, and community acceptance.

A. Target segments
- Primary: Low- to lower-middle income households eligible for subsidised or financed housing schemes.
- Secondary: Government (bulk procurement for public housing), employers (defense, police academies), and NGO/ donor-funded projects.

B. Sales channels
- Direct sales through RGS sales teams and local offices.
- Partnerships with local government housing programmes and microfinance lenders.
- Bulk sales to institutional buyers (government & corporate housing projects).
- Agent network: Local community agents and trusted leaders for community outreach.

C. Pricing & finance
- Base selling price (2026): $31,000 per home (R500,000 equivalent). Prices escalated at 4% p.a. in models.
- Purchase routes: upfront purchase, developer financing, or mortgage/soft loan with local banks and micro-lenders.
- Subsidy & collaboration: work with municipal and national housing subsidy programmes where applicable to accelerate affordability.

D. Sales operations & pipeline management
- CRM: centralized CRM for lead tracking, conversion, and aftersales.
- Pre-sale campaigns: landowner agreements, community workshops, and demonstration units (show houses).
- Acceptance & handover process: quality sign-off, gas cylinder & appliance safety checks, and community induction for LPG use.

E. Customer retention & service
- Halso to provide cylinder refill subscription and service; RGS to support initial appliance installs and warranties.
- Community engagement and local training to promote safe usage and rapid replacement logistics.

5. Operations model & implementation

- Modular manufacturing: centralized off-site manufacturing hubs with quality control and rapid shipping to sites.
- Site operations: package delivery, foundation and utilities, installation teams (managed locally), and a commissioning team for gas & solar.
- Logistics: cylinder refill depots and a distribution network run by Halso (dedicated flows to project communities).
- Staffing: local hires prioritized for construction, logistics and aftersales — job creation is a key impact metric.

6. Governance, legal and risk management

- Structure: Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) holds project assets. Equity shareholders (RGS, Halso, others) appoint board members proportionate to equity. BCG as senior lender will have customary covenants and project monitoring rights.
- Legal: mutually appointed law firms; escrow and milestone-based drawdowns; detailed MoU before binding equity transfer.
- Key risks & mitigants:
  - Construction & delivery risk: use of proven modular systems, third-party QA, and phased rollouts.
  - Interest & financing risk: phased drawdowns; refinance options; hedging strategies for currency exposure.
  - Off-take/occupancy risk: blended sales channels, government partnerships, and pre-sales.
  - Regulatory & permitting: early stakeholder engagement with chiefs, local government, and environmental impact assessments.

7. Financial statements (deliverables)

Attached in the Financials folder are the following files:
- Halso_Gas_PnL_2026_2045.csv — detailed 20-year annual P&L for Halso's gas operations (nominal USD, includes inflation to revenue, COGS/OpEx at fixed %s, 25% corporate tax, post-tax net profit column).
- README_FINANCIALS.md — explains assumptions, formulas, and how to convert these CSVs into an Excel workbook with linked three-statement financials.

Key financial highlights (high level):
- Halso (Gas) 20-year nominal revenue: ~$460M; post-tax net profit: ~$103.5M (assumes 4% annual inflation on gas pricing, 60% COGS, 10% OpEx, 25% tax).
- RGS Housing (Project) — 20-year projections show substantial developer profits (models in notes). Early-year ramping costs and interest create variability, with peak mid-build profits and strong cumulative returns when combined with long-term gas value.

8. Analytics and KPIs (what we've calculated)

Provided analytics include:
- Annual and cumulative post-tax profit for Halso's gas business (2026–2045);
- Key investment metrics: Project IRR and NPV range (model outputs available in README_FINANCIALS); Halso equity IRR in existing model scenarios was high (sample IRR ~70% for Limpopo-scale); project-level IRR (levered) ~87–88% in sample runs — these are illustrative based on assumptions and should be re-run in Excel with your chosen discount rate.

Suggested KPIs to monitor during execution:
- Units completed and units sold per quarter
- Occupancy and active gas subscriptions (% of homes)
- Cylinder refill frequency and liters/cyl per month
- Cash burn / runway (pre-loan drawdown)
- Debt utilization and covenant headroom
- Net Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow (after interest)

9. Sales & marketing collateral (recommended)

- Investor pitch deck (refined PowerPoint) for Halso board and BCG; we can produce slide-ready art from this plan.
- One-page executive summary for government and lenders.
- Sales brochures and community information packs in English and Sesotho.

10. Next steps & deliverables I can produce now

- Convert the CSV financials into a linked Excel workbook with three statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) and scenario toggles for: inflation rate, COGS %, OpEx %, tax rate, and alternative rollout speed.
- Add sensitivity analysis and charts: NPV/IRR sensitivity to discount rate, price per home, and unit delivery schedule.
- Produce an investor PowerPoint using charts and topline figures.
- Produce a one-page MoU draft and a term sheet for Halso and RGS to refine.
