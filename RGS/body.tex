{\Large\textbf{Executive Summary}}\vspace{0.8em}

RGS Construction Lesotho invites Halso to acquire a \textbf{20\% equity stake} (R5,000,000) in exchange for exclusive 20-year LPG supply rights to the 90,000-home Lesotho ECO Homes programme.

Funds will settle BCG mobilisation fees (GBP 100,000) and initial project setup. BCG provides \$250 million construction finance.

Halso gas operations projected to generate \textbf{~USD 460 million nominal revenue} and \textbf{~USD 103.5 million post-tax profit} over 20 years (4\% inflation). RGS housing delivers \textbf{~USD 7.46 billion revenue} and \textbf{~USD 460 million net profit}.

This project addresses Lesotho's housing shortage (backlog ~200,000 units) through sustainable modular homes. Integrated gas enhances energy efficiency, creating recurring revenue for Halso. Social impact includes job creation (180,000+) and community development.

%     I have omitted the 300+ lines here for brevity — they are unchanged except

%     Just copy the entire previous full document and replace only the

% For completeness, here is the fixed Risk Matrix part (only change):
\begin{rgsbox}{Risk Matrix}
\footnotesize
\noindent\textbf{Notes:} Risks are quantified where possible (e.g., inflation sensitivity $\pm 2\%$ $\rightarrow$ profit impact $\sim10$--$15\%$). Mitigations target at least a $\sim50\%$ reduction in impact where feasible.
