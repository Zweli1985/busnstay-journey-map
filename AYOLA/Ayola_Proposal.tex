\section{1. BUSINESS BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW}
Ayola Projects (Pty) Ltd is a 100\% Black youth-owned, Level 1 B-BBEE contributor registered under number 2019/031844/07, operating from East London in the Eastern Cape Province.

The business is a start-up multidisciplinary enterprise offering integrated services in:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Branding and digital marketing
  \item Multimedia and audio-visual (AV) production
  \item Event production and support services
  \item Business development support and funding-related content
  \item Digital systems and training, including web design, app development, and graphic design
\end{itemize}

Additionally, through our in-house record label Zwesta Empire, we produce commercial-grade music, leveraging the platform of resident DJ and producer DJ Zwesta SA (featured on Gagasi FM and Ukhozi FM). This enables revenue streams from music royalties, events, and cross-promotion.

The company is managed by directors with backgrounds in creative production, operations, and enterprise development. Ayola Projects was established to address the demand for affordable, professional, and locally accessible multimedia and digital solutions for SMMEs, corporates, and public-sector supported enterprises in the Eastern Cape.

This positioning allows the business to fill a critical gap in the regional creative economy, supporting digital transformation and content creation needs.

\section{2. PROBLEM STATEMENT / BUSINESS NEED}
Despite growing demand for professional multimedia, podcasts, livestreams, corporate videos, digital branding content, IT services, and music production, access to high-quality facilities in the Eastern Cape remains limited and expensive, particularly for SMMEs and youth-owned enterprises.

Current operational constraints include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Dependence on rented or outsourced equipment
  \item High recurring rental costs that erode profitability
  \item Equipment unavailability during peak periods
  \item Inconsistent production quality from shared assets
  \item Inability to scale operations or create permanent jobs
  \item Limited working capital for initial operational setup and marketing
\end{itemize}

Without ownership of core AV, audio, and computing equipment and sufficient working capital, the business cannot operate efficiently or sustainably. The Asset Assist Programme is essential to overcome these barriers and enable full operational capability.

\section{3. PURPOSE OF FUNDING REQUEST}
Ayola Projects applies for R250,000.00 to acquire essential multimedia and professional audio production equipment and provide initial working capital.

Funding allocation:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item R238,305.00 for productive assets per attached quotations
  \item R11,695.00 for working capital (initial marketing, utilities, and operational expenses to support launch)
\end{itemize}

These assets and working capital will establish an in-house production facility supporting a broader range of services, including music production and IT-related design work.

All assets are directly productive and will be used daily for income-generating activities across AV production, music recording, and IT services (e.g., high-performance computing for web design, app development, and graphic design).

\begin{impactbox}
\textbf{Impact of Equipment on Expanded Operations} \\
- iPhones enable mobile 4K/8K capture and on-site editing \\
- iMac \& MacBook Pro provide high-performance post-production, graphic design, web/app development, video editing, animation, and colour grading \\
- Audio interface, monitors, and microphones create a professional podcast, music recording, and mixing studio \\
- Full setup supports livestreaming, hybrid events, corporate film production, and commercial music releases \\
This will increase project throughput by 30\%, enable premium service offerings, and unlock additional revenue from music royalties and events via DJ Zwesta SA's radio presence on Gagasi FM and Ukhozi FM.
\end{impactbox}
